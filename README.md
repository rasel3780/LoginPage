# Simple Login Page

Developed by: Rasel Kibria

The Login page has input fields for a username and password, a login button, and basic client-side validation


### The project consists of three main files:
<ol>
    <li>
        index.html: HTML file containing the structure of the login page.
    </li>
    <li>
        styles.css: CSS file containing styles for the login page.
    </li>
    <li>
        script.js: JavaScript file containing client-side validation logic. The loginValidation() function is called when the login button is clicked, checking whether both the username and password fields are filled. It shows an alert with an error message if any field is empty; otherwise, it shows an alert indicating a successful login.
    </li>
</ol>
